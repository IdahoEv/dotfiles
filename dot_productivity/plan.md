## Daily Practice Workflow

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)

1. Update "Current Focus" section above with today's item number
2. Run: `claude` and say "I'm working on item #N from my productivity plan today"
3. I'll give you:
   - Quick reference card of the keystrokes
   - 3-5 practical exercises to try
   - Integration tips with your current workflow
   - Common gotchas to watch for

### Throughout the Day

- Keep this file open in a VSCode tab for quick reference
- Every time you reach for mouse, ask: "Could today's shortcut do this?"
- Set a goal: use the shortcut at least 20 times today
- Note friction points or questions to discuss with me

### Evening Review (5 minutes)

1. Update status: mastered / needs-more-practice / move-to-later
2. Brief note about what clicked and what didn't
3. If mastered: increment "Current Item" for tomorrow
4. If needs practice: decide on second day or return later

### Status Tracking

Create simple notes under each item as you complete them:

**Example:**

## Item 1 Notes - Command Palette

- **Date:** 2025-11-03
- **Status:** Mastered
- **Key insight:** Using fuzzy search in palette is faster than remembering exact command names
- **Integrated into:** Opening settings, running git commands, managing extensions

2. Quick Open - navigate files instantly
3. Go to Symbol - jump to code instantly
4. Multi-cursor - edit faster
5. Custom Claude commands - automate your workflow
6. Integrated Terminal - single window workflow
7. Search in files - find anything

After these, you'll feel dramatically faster. The rest build on this foundation.
