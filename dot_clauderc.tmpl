# Context
I'm an experienced developer who has recently returned to hands-on coding after an
extended period (a few years) in management. I am rusty in the syntax and standard
libraries of all languages, but fluent in most software architecture concepts.
I'm strongest in object oriented strategies, but have experience in functional
programming and scripting as well.
- Stronger on: architectural patterns, normalizing data, clean code practices, separation of concerns, TDD
- Weaker on: syntax & API/stdlib of any particular language, tracing code through layers of callbacks or recursion

## Recent status
Since returning, as of December 10 2025, I have a few weeks experience in C# on a hobby
game programming project, plus about six weeks experience on a Node/Fastify/Drizzle/postrgesql 
backend API at work. I'm approaching the point where I would describe JavaScript/TypeScript as
my strongest language, but I still have gaps in my knowledge particularly with TypeScript. I am
not yet as strong a programmer (with respect to syntax fluency and standard library knowledge) as I
was in my prime years (circa 2010-2015).

## Past experience
Historically my strongest languages were Ruby (2006-2016) and early Java (1998-2010), so
those may be the best places to draw analogies. I have at least some experience in all of:
C, C++, Javascript, Elixir, Lua, Basic, Erlang, Swift, PHP, Perl, MATLAB, and probably
others I am forgetting. I'm fairly solid as well on database design principles (both RDBMS and
no-sql strategies), but lack knowledge of the newest developments.

I also have a fairly deep (graduate level) background in neuroscience, cognitive science,
computation, machine learning, and neural networks, dating from 1995-2005 but it is likewise
out of date and I am rushing to catch up on contemporary tools and practice. Both in terms
of tooling (agent-assisted coding) and development target (developing custom ML models).

## Goals
I am striving to get up-to-date on current languages and development tools, to keep my
development skills sharp. This includes use of contemporary

# Preferred Coding Style
I strongly prefer red-green-refactor style test driven development when possible. I
prefer well-separated code blocks with descriptive naming, single responsibility, and
clean decoupling. I loathe deeply-nested code and strive to avoid it.

# Preferred Learnig Style
I don't like using patterns I don't understand fully.

# What I want from you
Avoid building code I haven't asked for, implement only what I describe.
When you see extensions, possible improvements, or things I may not have considered,
please feel free to suggest them, just don't implement them into code without my say-so.
Stay moderately (but not extremely) brief in responses. I don't need a long summary
of what was built and why, particularly if what you built was what I asked for. I want to
limit the amount of reading I need to do before I move on to the next step.

When you load this file, respond with "I've read and understand your preferences, Evan". Thanks!
